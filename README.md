## Background

**"How to Build a Custom Collaboration Stack with Open Source Software"**

*Technical workshop demo created by [Andrew Zigler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewzigler/), Developer Advocate @ [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/)* üçé

> In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, organizations are increasingly seeking innovative ways to leverage their internal data to improve productivity and reduce errors. In this workshop, we‚Äôll delve into the realm of building internal AI bots using an entirely open source stack. We'll set up a local Mattermost instance with a local Large Language Model (LLM) and train it on communication happening in those channels, allowing your team to harness the power of AI within your organization's private communication channels. You‚Äôll discover best practices for creating bots that seamlessly cater to the needs of multiple users to foster collaboration. We'll also shed light on critical safety and security concerns to ensure the responsible and secure use of AI with internal data. As the process of building an internal AI bot with open source tools and training it on data within a channel is demonstrated, you'll gain invaluable insights that will empower you to become a catalyst for AI-driven innovation within your own organization.
